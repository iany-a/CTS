naming convention for interfaces: Name + "able"

dotted line > uses (either generate objects or store them or both) - composition

Checked exceptions >>> **compiler error on throw. do something about it.**



Lists (array list), set (unique values list), Hash table (dispersion table)



IntelliSense:

Eclipse -> right click the source file

IntelliJ -> right click the class file



for classes it is important to add final = you can't extend it



**constructor needs super() to call the superclass constructor!**
